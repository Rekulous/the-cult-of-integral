[Chorus E]
Goodbye brightness, my new enemy
You've come to say nothing with me today?                                                                                             Because a sound loudly stomping
Took its seeds while you was awake
And the sound that was removed from your brain
Still is gone outside the vision of loudness

[Chorus D]
In peaceful nightmares, you walked with me
Long roads not made of cobblestone
'Bove the group one elements of a road sign
You straightened your collar to the hot and humid
When your nose were stabbed by the boom of a group 0 elements have no opposite sound
That put together the day, and distanced itself from the vision of loudness

[Chorus C]
And in the fully clothed sound you heard
no animals, maybe less
Animals viewing with speaking
Animals viewing with seeing
Animals reading literature that eyes did steal
And everyone requested to not disturb the vision of loudness

[Chorus B]
"Intellectuals," heard you, "I do know
Visions like a healthy man shrinks
See your drawings that you might teach me
Give your legs that you may never reach me"
But your drawings, like loud sunrays, flew
And lowered in volume, in the droughts of vision.

[Chorus A]
And the animals stood and sinned
To the group 0 elements have no opposite devil I made
And the lamp boomed in its compliment
In the drawing that it was not forming
And the lamp saw, "The drawings of the truth tellers are drawn on the high-class ground and tenement floors
And shouted in the vision of loudness"
