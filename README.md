# The Cult of Integral
The cult of Integral is a cult fromed on the 19th May, 2021. The cult worships the Intergration symbol, the "Integral" and its goals are to create a large number of copypastas in the hope of making its presence known on [r/copypasta.](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/) Every time a cult member posts a copypasta they have made/discovered, they will include a link to this repository. Therefore, by the power of the Intergral, the integral itself will become a copypasta and, once the integral itself becomes integrated to a copypasta, we will ascend to new heights and rule over the land of [r/copypasta](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/) forever. The cult of integral is led by [u/xSerpentine](https://www.reddit.com/user/xSerpentine).

### How to contribute to the cause.
To contribute to the cause, simply add "**Source: The Cult of Integral**" to any copypastas you post onto r/copypasta (Include with the real source if you took the copypasta from somewhere else!). This text should link back to this github repository (link: https://github.com/Catterall/the-cult-of-integral). You can also view our links below.

**I was originally planning to open a public discord server, but instead it will be a group server, consisting of those who both wish to join the cult and those who I deem to be good at making, at least decent, copypastas.**
